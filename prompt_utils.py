_sqlite_prompt = """You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.
Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause as per SQLite. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns from the candidate list [{col_list}] and the selection must be based on the meaning of input question. Wrap each column name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist in the candidate list. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
Pay attention to use date('now') function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".

Use the following format:

Question: Question here
SQLQuery: SQL Query to run
SQLResult: Result of the SQLQuery
Answer: Final answer here

"""

PROMPT_SUFFIX = """Only use the following tables:
{table_info}

Question: {input}"""
